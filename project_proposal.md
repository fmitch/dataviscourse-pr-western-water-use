# Project Proposal

County precipitation/temperature data: ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/

County FIPS codes: https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/home/?cid=nrcs143_013697

Utah Water Use 1985-2015: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ut/nwis/water_use/ Other states are also available.

Suggest: Map with multiple colorings selectable
* Annual precipitation
* Water consumption
  * Domestic consumption
  * Domestic consumption per capita
  * Industrial consumption
  * Agriculture/Irrigation consumption
* Ability to set any variable over any other variable. (Precipitation per capita, Domestic consumption per precipitation
* Ability to select multiple counties and add their stats (Select Salt Lake + Utah + Summit + Wasatch, etc
  * Have pre-setting for drainage areas? Hard, but roughly doable.
  * Have pre-setting for state selection.
  * Group selection option based on currect selection of counties

On side of map, scatter plots of different axes, similar to HW4
Slider to select multiple years?
