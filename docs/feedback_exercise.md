Feedback from Carter Davis, Byson Oar, and Paul Muehleip:

We could use color/size of points on the scatter plot to represent a third variable as a dropdown. This may complicate the plot, but could allow for more expression of different variables. This is easily implementable with our current code, so we will add this and consider if it works well.

They definitely approved of the idea of selecting different counties and using that as a method of storytelling. Their interest in this makes us believe this should be a primary feature rather than an optional last-minute addition. One suggestion was to automatically select different counties that are similar by some metric (climate, population, etc.).  This should definitely be a priority for us.

One note is that we should open with a US map, then once a state is selected, we can transition from that map to the general data view.

The Point-of-Interest views where we compare different categories seems to be a little confusing, so we should put some thought into how exactly we want to communicate this data. Are these water categories best shown as parts of a whole, or would this be more useful as relative values? This may require options to do both, and either we pick one or set it as a toggle.

This feedback was fair and reasonable. In general, they were just suggesting features that might be more interesting or provide clarity, which we appreciated. We definitely will incorporate these suggestions in our design as time permits.
